# nosql-challenge

I began this challenge by following the templete provided.
Throughout this challenge i reflected back to the problems we solved in class and i was able to walk through most of the challenge.
The only problem i ran by was on Question #3. i reach out to a tutor and he walked me through the problem. 
Over all this assignment was straight foward and easier than the rest.
